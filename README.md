This is a highly opinionated Arch Install script specific to my needs. Use at your own risk.

Inspiration taken from easy-arch (https://github.com/classy-giraffe/easy-arch) and alis (https://github.com/picodotdev/alis).

On command line of Arch ISO, execute the following commands to execute the installation script:

curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nellaja/ballista/main/download.sh | bash
vim ballista.conf           
./ballista.sh
